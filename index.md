# learning how to communicate using Markdown
I tried to use git and GitHub in the command line to complete this exercise  
These are the steps I used to do that 

1. First I cloned the the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/noureddineidali/skills-communicate-using-markdown.git`  
> I'am already logged in with my GitHub account

2. Then I used `git fetch origin` to get the up-to-date information about the remote branches

3. I then checked out the branch start-markdown from the remote repo to the local repo using `git checkout -b start-markdown origin/start-markdown`
> In this branch the authors provided an empty file **index.md** which is the current file I am editing right now
